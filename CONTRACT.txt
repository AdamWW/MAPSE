              _.-# Purpose Statement and Team Objectives #-._

This team has been formed to complete the SE group assignment as part of Course CSC-380.
Our overall objectives are to master the course material related to this project and to demonstrate
that mastery through our final report and presentation. We are also committed to working effectively
as a team, by monitoring our process effectiveness, following through on commitments and
helping one another to learn.

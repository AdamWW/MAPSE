              _.-# Purpose Statement and Team Objectives #-._

This team has been formed to complete the SE group assignment as part of Course CSC-380.
Our overall objectives are to master the course material related to this project and to demonstrate
that mastery through our final report and presentation. We are also committed to working effectively
as a team, by monitoring our process effectiveness, following through on commitments and
helping one another to learn.


              _.-# Team Communication #-._

We will communicate with one another through various means. Electronic and phone
communication are the most widely used modes outside of meetings. Prompt responses to
messages/inquiries from one another are expected. If a member is unable to deliver as
promised, they should advise the group in advance so that alternate arrangements can be
made.

              _.-# Work Expectations and Communication #-._

Each team member is expected to contribute an equal and adequate portion of work on the
project. Tasks will be assigned regularly during meetings and each member is expected to 
complete their task in a timely manner. Delays or problems should be communicated to the 
group as soon as they are encountered. A work log will be maintained to ensure communication,
accountability, and ease in identifying changes made.

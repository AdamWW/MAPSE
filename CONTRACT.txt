######################## GROUP CONTRACT ########################
----------------------------------------------------------------

We, the persons named below, do hereby agree individually to the
following terms during the period defined by the Fall semester
at SUNY Oswego, between the dates 08/27/2012 - 12/17/2012.


              _.-# Purpose Statement and Team Objectives #-._

This team has been formed to complete the SE group assignment as part of Course CSC-380.
Our overall objectives are to master the course material related to this project and to demonstrate
that mastery through our final report and presentation. We are also committed to working effectively
as a team, by monitoring our process effectiveness, following through on commitments and
helping one another to learn.


              _.-# Team Communication #-._

We will communicate with one another through various means. Electronic and phone
communication are the most widely used modes outside of meetings. Prompt responses to
messages/inquiries from one another are expected. If a member is unable to deliver as
promised, they should advise the group in advance so that alternate arrangements can be
made.

              _.-# Work Expectations and Communication #-._

Each team member is expected to contribute an equal and adequate portion of work on the
project. Tasks will be assigned regularly during meetings and each member is expected to 
complete their task in a timely manner. Delays or problems should be communicated to the 
group as soon as they are encountered. A work log will be maintained to ensure communication,
accountability, and ease in identifying changes made.

              _.-# Bullet Points #-._
              
	* I will endeavor to communicate with the other members of my group through the
		various means agreed to by the group as a whole. Electronic (email, IM,...)
		and phone communication are the most widely used outside meetings. I further
		agree to give prompt response to messages and inquiries from other members
		of the group.
			  
	* I will show up to all meetings ready to work. If something important comes up that forces
		me to miss a meeting after I've agreed to it, I will email or phone at least one group
		member who will be at that meeting to let them know I will miss it. I will catch up on
		what was discussed BEFORE the next meeting; I will not take up time during the next
		meeting to catch up.
		
	* I will explicitly (either verbally with group members or through email) agree to task
		deadlines and I will complete my individual assignments by those deadlines. If I can't
		complete my task by the deadline because of schedule disruptions, I will call or email
		at least one group member to explain the problem and will commit to a new deadline with
		that person. If I can't complete my task because it proves to be more difficult or complex
		than I originally thought, I will call or email at least one group member to ask for help.
		At the next meeting I will explain why I couldn't finish the task and, with the group's help,
		reorganize the task and set a new deadline.
		
	* I will listen sympathetically to the problems my group members have with completing
		tasks, and will always think to offer solutions or "work arounds" to help work get
		done. This, of course, works well until a group member consistently fabricates excuses
		as to why work has not been completed.
		
	* I will volunteer for task assignments rather than avoid them. I do this because
		I realize that the more work I get to do properly, the more I will learn about
		the subject, and the better off I'll be.
		
	* Keeping the above in mind, I will not take on more than my fair share of work thus
		keeping others from getting involved, nor will I be unnecessarily dictatorial
		in telling others what to do.

	** I will do my best to make every contribution that I can to the content and the
		organization of both the project and the presentation.
		
	**I will keep in touch with my fellow group members, and will take good notes
		during any meetings.
		
	** My contributions to the project and presentation will be of high quality
		such that they clearly fit into the intended context and do not require
		rewriting by the other group members.
		
	** I will submit my designated parts of the project and presentation to my
		fellow group members in a timely manner (github). In addition, I will
		be sure to meet other interim goals created by the group.
		
	By writing your name below with your student ID you signify understanding and
	agreement to the above contract and terms.

Project Description
	The application will feature the use of GPS and will be designed to be used while driving.

	There are two main features of the application. The first is a speed limit indicator which will
	alert the driver to the current speed limit and if they are approaching this speed. Speed
	limit information will be pulled from a database on the web. There will be a visual indicator,
	including a changing background color which alerts the driver when they are approaching a customizable
	speed limit threshold.

	The second feature is an upcoming attractions display. The user can choose the types of 
	attractions they are interested in seeing (examples: rest stops, restaurants, stores, etc.).
	The program will display upcoming attractions in a useful and intuitive manner.

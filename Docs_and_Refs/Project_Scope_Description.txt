Project Description
	The application will feature the use of GPS and will be designed to be used while driving.

	There are two main features of the application. The first is a speed limit indicator which will
	alert the driver to the current speed limit and if they are approaching this speed. Speed
	limit information will be pulled from a database on the web. There will be a visual indicator,
	including a changing background color which alerts the driver when they are approaching a customizable
	speed limit threshold.

	The second feature is an upcoming attractions display. The user can choose the types of 
	attractions they are interested in seeing (examples: rest stops, restaurants, stores, etc.).
	The program will display upcoming attractions in a useful and intuitive manner.

Features list
	- Display speed limit.
	- Display speed that user is going.
	- Visual cue to approaching speed limit (color change).
	- Customizable threshold.
	- Customizable alarm.

	- Upcoming attractions display.
	- Customizable local interests/attractions.
	- Searchable local interests. (Optional if we need more features)
	- Upcoming attractions are prioritized by what is on the current street but also will display attractions
	  within a certain range (radius or actual driving range?).
	- Attractions can be "clicked" on in order to launch GPS navigation (seperate Android application) to navigate
	  to said attraction.
	- Other attraction will be available including phone number. Phone number can be clicked on in order to call.
